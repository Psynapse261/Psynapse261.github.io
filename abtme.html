										<h1>A peek into my life</h1>

									<p>
										I have always been passionate about technology, and wanting to contribute to it since I was in high school.
										I decided to take a bottom to top approach to my education in the field, going from learning about hardware
										to software. I did my undergraduate studies in Electronics and Communication Engineering from the 
										National Institute of Technology, Surat. There I learnt about the intricacies of the hardware and how a bunch
										of transistors come together to make computer processors. I also learnt the basics of computer programming, 
										and how software interfaces with the hardware with just 1's and 0's. Currently I am pursuing a Master's 
										degree in Computer Science, and learning about different avenues the software can be applied in. I aspire to 
										contribute to innovative technologies and create real world solutions to industry problems.
									</p>
									<p>
										Apart from academics, I have also worked in various student organizations and held positions of responsibility
										in both technical and non-technical clubs. On the technical side, I was an executive and then the Chairperson
										of the student body committe in the IETE Students' Forum at NIT Surat. I was in charge of managing different
										events like organizing expert talks on emerging technologies and conducting quizzes/hackathons/circuit design
										competitions for students to sharpen their skills through the spirit of competition. I was also an executive
										at the Literary Affairs Committe at NIT Surat, where I worked on my soft skills through debating, group discussions
										and book reading clubs. Later on I was a mentor to my juniors to help them grow their soft skills, and in turn 
										sharpen mine.
									</p>
									<p>
										If you are reading so far then you might actually be interested in what I do in my free time. I enjoy playing video
										games and consider them to be an amalgamtion of all the other forms of entertainment. I am a beginner in playing
										the flute and try to practice it from time to time. I am also fueled by coffee, and love enjoying coffees from 
										different estates and different ways of processing. If you are curious, I prefer lighter roasts and my favourite
										processing is the honey sun-dried process. I would love to talk to you about it!
